# Group repository and actual member evidence

Prepared during Prompt 03 on 2026-10-07. This record supports pages 2-4 of `IT415 Acceptance Checklist.pdf`; it does not replace instructor verification..

## Member identities and branches

| ID | Member name | GitHub username / profile URL | Actual feature branch(es) | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| M1 | Agbas | Pending | None recorded | Membership supplied; authored work not verified |
| M2 | Daro | Pending | None recorded | Membership supplied; authored work not verified |
| M3 | Magos | https://github.com/Yray0-9 (authenticated account used for this requested checkpoint) | codex/setup-foundation; codex/ui-foundation (Prompt 04 implemented/pushed); catalog-data (Prompt 05 committed/pushed; PR #3; prior local codex/catalog-data name removed) | Current requester; setup/UI Git and PR author Yray0-9; human explanation and instructor verification pending |

Do not infer profile ownership from repository ownership. Preserve merged-branch names through their actual PR and commits; a branch deleted after merge is not automatically missing evidence.

## Contribution / PR register

| ID | Actual feature/task evidence | Commit SHA(s) / count | PR URL / number and source -> target | Reviewer, feedback resolution, merge status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| M1 | Pending actual task/contribution | Pending | Pending | Pending |
| M2 | Pending actual task/contribution | Pending | Pending | Pending |
| M3 | AI-assisted setup/scaffold and planning/evidence records requested by Magos; see AI_LOG.md and TEST_RESULTS.md | Setup: [a20201a](https://github.com/Yray0-9/pos-app/commit/a20201aeb262959b4d38f5f80bed78a3b5e8d56f); [checkpoint evidence c7860f7](https://github.com/Yray0-9/pos-app/commit/c7860f703cf3f0b5c121eb82151d5662171165d0); subsequent review-status history visible on branch | [#1](https://github.com/Yray0-9/pos-app/pull/1), codex/setup-foundation -> main; author Yray0-9 | Open and unmerged; Copilot attempt could not review due to quota, no inline findings. Genuine reviewer (Agbas or Daro with verified account) still needed; no review request/message sent by this checkpoint |
| M3 | Original Common Table UI and modern revision; local Tailwind, reusable templates/assets, visual/keyboard checks and evidence | UI implementation [6ff4a07](https://github.com/Yray0-9/pos-app/commit/6ff4a07cbc410b3436c6f6e2c4ed152fac33977b); 1 implementation commit before evidence follow-up | [#2](https://github.com/Yray0-9/pos-app/pull/2), codex/ui-foundation -> codex/setup-foundation; author Yray0-9 | Open/unmerged; Copilot quota entry has no inline findings; genuine non-author review pending |

Magos requested the changes; Codex generated/adapted the code and records. Magos's own evaluation, modifications, demonstration, and explanations must be supplied rather than inferred. The existing Initial commit's authorship is not attributed here without identity verification.

## Individual verification matrix

Use P/F/N/A in the instructor's form only when verified or assigned appropriately. Here, **Pending** means not yet verified; it is not an instructor-awarded pass, fail, or exemption.

## Real development history checklist

- [ ] At least seven real stages represented in committed history.
- [x] Setup represented by a real committed/pushed milestone. Review and integration still pending.
- [x] Interface represented by actual committed/pushed UI milestone; review/integration pending.
- [ ] Core functionality.
- [ ] Validation.
- [ ] Genuine bug fix.
- [ ] Genuine refactoring.
- [ ] Documentation.
- [ ] Feature branches pushed, PR source/target recorded, genuine review before merge, and actual feedback resolved.
- [ ] Completed PRs merged; final demonstrated app matches recorded integration revision.

Seven stages are not seven arbitrary/artificial commits. A dependency/network or tool quoting problem alone is not being presented as a kiosk application bug-fix stage. Keep a real application issue and its fix when one occurs. Commit count alone does not establish authorship.

## Next evidence to collect

Individual profile URLs, actual Git identity, accepted feature assignments, group number/section, instructor access, clone demonstration, branch/network reference, real feature commits/PRs/reviews, and member explanations are still needed. Work may continue on independent setup/design tasks while these are pending.

## Setup checkpoint (2026-10-07, about 12:06 Asia/Singapore)

Authenticated GitHub login Yray0-9 has push permission for Yray0-9/pos-app. The existing configured Git name/email were preserved; no alternate author or impersonated member identity was supplied. Remote main matched the initial commit before push. The setup branch was created after Prompt 03's explicitly non-Git stage and before its checkpoint commit; no assertion that it existed during the earlier edits is made. Future feature branches must be established before feature editing.

PR #1 was created and attached to this chat. It is open, not merged, with no actual review/feedback to resolve yet. Choose a genuine non-author reviewer; the other members' accounts remain pending. An AI inspection or PR creation does not replace that review. A follow-up documentation commit records the actual checkpoint links on this same branch; it is genuine evidence maintenance, not an artificial extra application stage. Final integration SHA remains pending.

Later API verification found a [Copilot bot entry](https://github.com/Yray0-9/pos-app/pull/1#pullrequestreview-5437513512) with state COMMENTED at 2026-10-07 12:06:44 Asia/Singapore. Its body reports that it could not review because the requester had reached the quota limit. The inline comment list was empty. This is not a completed substantive review or human approval; there are no requested code changes to address from it. Record the attempted review accurately and leave actual review/merge pending. No reviewer was contacted by the assistant.

## Local UI branch preparation (2026-10-07, 12:17 Asia/Singapore)

- User explicitly invoked reusable E; only local branch preparation and documentation were authorized.
- Intended contributor/requester: M3 - Magos, using the existing configured Git identity. This records intent, not completed UI work or a member demonstration.
- Intended task: Prompt 04, original Common Table UI foundation, kiosk app/route, reusable HTML base, local Tailwind build, and scoped visual checks. None implemented during this branch-preparation step.
- Entry state: clean codex/setup-foundation at `717b165c852ad2c771fbc506ffb3578529a75b46`. Setup PR #1 verified open and unmerged; main remains the initial integration state locally.
- Created local `codex/ui-foundation` from `codex/setup-foundation` at that same SHA. No existing appropriate UI branch was found. No commit, push, PR creation, merge, reset, force operation, or identity change occurred.
- This is a dependent branch: while setup remains unmerged, the eventual UI PR should compare against codex/setup-foundation to show UI-only changes. After setup is merged, inspect main and retarget/reconcile through a separately authorized Git checkpoint; do not silently merge, rewrite history, or include setup as new UI authorship.
- Verified branch point and zero committed difference from its parent before recording this step. The private .env, venv, local database, and all tracked files were preserved. No kiosk directory exists yet.
- Branch-preparation record edits remain uncommitted on codex/ui-foundation for the next scoped milestone. UI push/PR, implementation evidence, reviewer, and human explanations remain pending.


## Prompt 04 — local implementation evidence

- Date: 2026-10-07, approximately 12:20–12:33 Asia/Singapore.
- Actual requester/responsible member: M3 Magos. Codex produced the UI foundation with AI assistance. Human evaluation, own code explanation, and individual demonstration remain pending; no work is attributed to M1 Agbas or M2 Daro.
- Actual local branch: codex/ui-foundation, prepared before UI edits through reusable E, based on setup commit 717b165. Intended assignment from the earlier preparation is now backed by uncommitted app/templates/CSS/build files and verified checks, not by a feature commit yet.
- Actual task: original Common Table reusable UI foundation; root kiosk route, Tailwind local build, accessible shared components, responsive browser inspection and evidence updates. No catalog/cart/payment feature is claimed.
- Evidence: TEST_RESULTS.md Prompt 04 section, DESIGN.md checkpoint, AI_LOG.md AI-04, and docs/evidence/ui-foundation-desktop.jpg (assistant browser capture; not a member Git or instructor demonstration).
- UI commit SHA, push, PR URL/source/target, real non-author reviewer, feedback and merge: pending. No Git mutation occurred in Prompt 04. Existing configured identity was not changed.
- Setup PR #1 remains open; its Copilot quota entry does not constitute substantive review. While setup is unmerged, UI review should compare against codex/setup-foundation. Genuine teammate review and their own implementation branches/contributions remain required or need an instructor-approved arrangement.


## UI design revision and user-managed Git

Magos requested a more modern design after rejecting the first rendered result as old-fashioned. Codex revised the existing uncommitted UI milestone and verified its local visuals/accessibility basics; evidence is in TEST_RESULTS.md and ui-foundation-modern-desktop.jpg. Revised visual acceptance and Magos's own evaluation/explanation remain pending. No Agbas/Daro work is asserted.

Magos now intends to perform Git operations personally. Notify/guide when the accepted interface milestone should be recorded and inspect supplied/actual evidence afterward; do not execute operations automatically under prior authorization. UI commit/push/PR/review and next branch records remain pending. Existing setup review and real member-contribution gaps are unchanged.


## UI checkpoint (2026-10-07, approximately 12:57–13:00 Asia/Singapore)

- Magos explicitly delegated reusable B after the revised preview despite earlier user-managed Git preference. Codex generated/adapted the UI and performed this authorized checkpoint; configured author/account Yray0-9 preserved. Personal evaluation/demonstration is not inferred.
- Actual implementation commit: [6ff4a07cbc410b3436c6f6e2c4ed152fac33977b](https://github.com/Yray0-9/pos-app/commit/6ff4a07cbc410b3436c6f6e2c4ed152fac33977b); message: Build original Common Table kiosk UI foundation. 28 scoped files, private environment/database/venv/package cache excluded.
- Actual branch: [codex/ui-foundation](https://github.com/Yray0-9/pos-app/tree/codex/ui-foundation), pushed with origin tracking. Actual [PR #2](https://github.com/Yray0-9/pos-app/pull/2), source codex/ui-foundation, target codex/setup-foundation; attached to chat.
- Parent setup PR #1 remains open/unmerged. Main unchanged; no merge/reset/force push/deployment or reviewer message.
- Actual feedback source: [Copilot quota entry](https://github.com/Yray0-9/pos-app/pull/2#pullrequestreview-5437802476), state COMMENTED with no inline comments/requested changes. Not completed review or human approval. Genuine non-author reviewer needed: Agbas/Daro with confirmed account or instructor-accepted reviewer.
- Follow-up evidence-only documentation records returned links on the same branch, not an artificial development stage. Other member feature branches/commits, member verification and explanations remain pending.

## Local UI workspace revision - no new Git evidence

Requester: M3 Magos. Assistant implemented/checked the user-requested layout adaptation on existing codex/ui-foundation at HEAD fa76162e758e72da445f729ce0d5e99d0faa8d71. Branch preparation was already performed for this UI milestone. Product illustrations/cards are static preview work; no catalog/cart/payment contribution is claimed.

This revision is uncommitted, has no new commit/PR link and is not yet part of PR #2. User visual acceptance and own evaluation/explanation are pending. Agbas/Daro contributions, confirmed accounts, independent reviewer/feedback and merges remain pending. No authorship changed, reviewer contacted or Git mutation performed. Evidence: DESIGN.md section 13, TEST_RESULTS.md workspace section and workspace screenshot.

## Reusable E - catalog/data branch preparation

2026-10-07, approximately 13:36-13:42 Asia/Singapore. Actual requester/intended contributor: M3 Magos, with AI assistance. Intended task: Prompt 05 product/completed-transaction/item models, Decimal fields, unique references, repeatable six-product seed and relevant verification. This is an intended assignment, not completed feature work. No work is attributed to Agbas or Daro.

Before editing, codex/ui-foundation was clean at 3cad483d1e930c23c0ae7d8f0e34ae451cdadd57, matching the locally recorded origin/UI ref. That existing commit records the latest 14-file UI workspace revision; author Yray0-9, actual message Initial project setup. It was not created or amended by this checkpoint, and no actor/approval is inferred from its message. No catalog branch existed. Created and switched to local codex/catalog-data at exactly the same SHA; no upstream, push, PR or implementation yet. Clean working tree verified immediately after switching; only branch/evidence documentation then changed.

Dependency: catalog branch builds on the prepared UI/setup history. A future scoped PR should target codex/ui-foundation while that dependency remains unintegrated, after checking actual remote/PR state at the authorized Git checkpoint. Main and local origin/main at 141af0103e8e73630acf76f867bfb5caeed07efe contain .env/generated artifacts and omit prepared application sources. They were not merged, reset or used as this base. Separate cleanup, exposed-secret assessment, genuine reviews/integration and member evidence remain pending. No secret values were printed.

## Requested UI evidence commit and branch naming plan

Magos requested recording the previous seven branch/evidence files on codex/ui-foundation. They are documentation for real setup/UI/next-branch state; no catalog code is included. Local configured author is preserved. Commit result will be recorded after creation on the next task branch. GitHub visibility requires a later push; no publication is asserted yet.

Proposed simplified grouping: existing codex/setup-foundation and codex/ui-foundation; catalog-data for Prompt 05; cart-review for 06-07; payments for 08-09; receipt-reset for 10. Six feature branches plus main are planned, not a completed branch inventory. Later review, genuine fixes/refactors, docs and member implementation tasks may require more. No teammate contribution is established by this proposal. The unused local codex/catalog-data has no feature commits; replace it from the updated UI base without retaining a duplicate task branch.

## UI evidence commit and Prompt 05 actual contribution record

- User-requested local UI documentation commit: 3ce83e25975870cc8fbadb42c3267086729117d7, configured author Yray0-9; message Record UI verification and catalog branch preparation. Seven reviewed evidence files only; secret/scope/whitespace checks passed. Local origin/UI remains 3cad483, so publication of this commit is pending. No new PR or independent review is asserted; commit URL becomes viewable after push.
- Actual feature branch: catalog-data from that UI evidence commit; no upstream. Unused codex/catalog-data had zero unique commits and was safely removed after replacement; published branch names retained. Application foundation/local files preserved.
- Actual requester/responsible member: M3 Magos, assisted by Codex. Implemented/tested Prompt 05 models, initial migration, repeatable catalog seed and data tests. Human evaluation/explanation/demonstration remain pending; Agbas/Daro work is not asserted.
- Data commit/push/PR/source-target/reviewer/feedback/merge: pending. Intended later PR target remains codex/ui-foundation while its dependency is unintegrated, with actual remote state checked at that checkpoint. Evidence: DATA.md, TEST_RESULTS.md and AI_LOG.md.

## Reusable E for cart/review - checkout dependency unresolved

2026-10-07, approximately 14:03-14:06 Asia/Singapore. Current requester: M3 Magos. Intended next work: Prompt 06 selection/session cart controls, then Prompt 07 review/navigation, on planned cart-review (simple name previously requested). This is an intended task, not an implemented contribution. No Agbas/Daro work inferred.

Actual checkout remains catalog-data at 3ce83e25975870cc8fbadb42c3267086729117d7, no upstream. No cart-review branch exists. Seven tracked documents and eight new files (DATA guide plus seven Python package/model/seed/migration/test files) remain uncommitted from Prompt 05. The initial migration was already applied locally, so moving or discarding it would break reproducibility/history. Models/seed/tests are the catalog prerequisite, not completed cart work.

No independent catalog commit authorization applies: previous explicit commit request was fulfilled on UI only; this E expressly prohibits commits/pushes/PRs/merges. Left branch/files intact and recorded the dependency. Next action: a scoped catalog Git checkpoint (reusable B or Magos's own actions), then E again before Prompt 06. Source/target/commit/PR evidence for catalog still pending. Main issue, UI publication, reviews and individual contributions remain unresolved.

## Combined B/E authorization and verified dependency

Magos explicitly requested catalog checkpoint B, then next-branch E. Actual account/configured author Yray0-9 retained. Seven prior docs plus DATA guide/model/seed/migration/tests are this catalog milestone, with no teammate contribution asserted. Existing UI evidence commit 3ce83e25975870cc8fbadb42c3267086729117d7 is now pushed as the parent dependency; no UI merge.

Fresh repo/PR inspection confirmed public Yray0-9/pos-app and push access, no catalog/cart-review remote branches or catalog PR yet. Parent PRs remain open/unmerged and their bot quota entries are not genuine approval. Intended catalog PR source catalog-data, target codex/ui-foundation while parent is unintegrated. Real non-author review needed from Agbas/Daro with confirmed accounts or an instructor-accepted reviewer; none contacted. E intends cart-review for Magos's Prompt 06-07 work, not a completed contribution.

## Catalog B checkpoint - actual Git/PR evidence

Configured author/account Yray0-9 retained; requester M3 Magos, AI-assisted implementation and checks. Implementation commit [a02288bca6d1fda50cfea7191066b25cf47e46e2](https://github.com/Yray0-9/pos-app/commit/a02288bca6d1fda50cfea7191066b25cf47e46e2); message Add catalog and completed-sale data foundation. Exactly 15 scoped model/migration/seed/test/guide/evidence files; private env/database/caches/helper excluded. Branch catalog-data pushed with origin tracking; [PR #3](https://github.com/Yray0-9/pos-app/pull/3) created/attached, open/unmerged, source catalog-data, target codex/ui-foundation. Parent UI evidence 3ce83e2 also pushed.

Actual review: [Copilot quota entry](https://github.com/Yray0-9/pos-app/pull/3#pullrequestreview-5438370873), COMMENTED, no inline findings/requested code changes. No substantive independent review or CI checks/statuses; no fabricated resolution. Need genuine non-author review by Agbas/Daro after confirming accounts or an instructor-accepted reviewer; none contacted. Parent PRs #1/#2 also remain unmerged. Main public .env issue confirmed; current local development key differs, no values displayed. Main cleanup/history remediation not performed.

A scoped documentation-only follow-up records returned links/status on catalog-data before E, not a manufactured extra development stage. E's intended task remains cart-review for Magos's Prompt 06-07; actual branch record follows its creation. Other member features, explanations, peer approval and merges remain pending.
